## 📱 How to Install on Android

### Method 1: Direct PWA Installation (Recommended)
1. **Open Chrome on your Android device**
2. **Navigate to your app URL** (e.g., `https://your-domain.com`)
3. **Look for the install prompt** that appears automatically
4. **Tap "Install"** to add to home screen
5. **Grant permissions** for notifications, camera, etc.

### Method 2: Manual Installation
1. **Open Chrome** and navigate to your app
2. **Tap the menu (⋮)** → **"Add to Home screen"**
3. **Confirm installation** and customize the name
4. **Find the app icon** on your home screen

### Method 3: Via WebAPK (Automatic)
- When users visit your site multiple times, Chrome automatically generates a WebAPK

- The app appears in the app drawer like any native app
