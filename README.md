## About

CypherChat is a real-time chat application designed with privacy and security in mind. Leveraging end-to-end encryption, it ensures that only the sender and receiver can read the messages, providing a secure communication channel. The application is built using TypeScript for type safety, React for a dynamic user interface, and Socket.IO for real-time communication.

This project addresses the increasing need for secure and private communication in a world where data breaches and privacy concerns are rampant. It targets individuals and organizations that prioritize confidentiality and require a reliable platform for secure messaging.

The architecture consists of a React-based frontend, a Node.js backend powered by Socket.IO for real-time communication, and end-to-end encryption implemented using cryptographic libraries. CypherChat distinguishes itself by its focus on user-friendly design coupled with robust security measures, making secure communication accessible to everyone.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages are encrypted on the sender's device and decrypted only on the receiver's device, ensuring maximum privacy.
- ⚡ **Real-time Communication**: Utilizes Socket.IO for instant message delivery and updates.
- 🔒 **Secure Key Exchange**: Implements a secure key exchange mechanism to establish encrypted communication channels.
- 🎨 **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive design for a seamless user experience.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works flawlessly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- 🛠️ **Extensible Architecture**: Designed for easy integration of new features and functionalities.

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// Example of sending an encrypted message
import { encryptMessage } from './utils/encryption';

const message = "Hello, this is a secret message!";
const publicKey = "YOUR_RECIPIENT_PUBLIC_KEY"; // Replace with the recipient's public key

const encryptedMessage = encryptMessage(message, publicKey);

console.log("Encrypted Message:", encryptedMessage);
```

### Advanced Examples

```typescript
// Example of decrypting an encrypted message
import { decryptMessage } from './utils/encryption';

const encryptedMessage = "ENCRYPTED_MESSAGE_FROM_SENDER"; // Replace with the actual encrypted message
const privateKey = "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"; // Replace with your private key

const decryptedMessage = decryptMessage(encryptedMessage, privateKey);

console.log("Decrypted Message:", decryptedMessage);
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to configure the application:

```env
# Server configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
