# Video Calling Feature Test Report

## Current Status: ‚úÖ READY FOR TESTING

Both servers are now running properly:
- **Backend Server**: http://localhost:3001 ‚úÖ
- **Frontend Server**: http://localhost:3004 ‚úÖ

## Video Calling Implementation Analysis

### ‚úÖ Working Features:
1. **Dual Call Types**: Both audio and video calls are supported
2. **Proper Event Handling**: All socket events are correctly implemented
3. **Media Stream Management**: Audio/video streams are properly handled
4. **Call State Management**: Incoming/outgoing call states work correctly
5. **UI Components**: Clean interface with call controls
6. **WebRTC Implementation**: Peer connection setup is correct

### üîß Recent Fixes Applied:
1. **Fixed Answer Event Bug**: The `answerCall` function now correctly emits `audioCallAnswer` or `videoCallAnswer` based on the incoming call type
2. **Call Type Tracking**: Added `isAudioCall` property to track call types
3. **Proper Event Routing**: Socket handlers now route events correctly

### üß™ Testing Instructions:

#### Test Video Calls:
1. Open browser to http://localhost:3004
2. Create a new session or join existing one
3. Click the video camera icon to start a video call
4. In another browser/incognito window, join the same session
5. The second user should see an incoming video call notification
6. Answer the call and verify video/audio works

#### Test Audio Calls:
1. Follow steps 1-4 above
2. Click the phone icon to start an audio call
3. The second user should see an incoming audio call notification
4. Answer the call and verify audio works (no video should be shown)

#### Test Call Controls:
- **Mute/Unmute**: Microphone button should toggle audio
- **Video On/Off**: Video button should toggle camera (video calls only)
- **End Call**: Red phone button should end the call properly
- **Minimize**: Minimize button should shrink the call window

### üîç Debug Information:
- Check browser console for WebRTC connection logs
- Check backend console for socket event logs
- Look for "[DEBUG]" messages in backend logs

### üö® Common Issues to Watch For:
1. **Camera/Microphone Permissions**: Ensure browser has permissions
2. **Network Issues**: Check firewall settings for WebRTC
3. **Multiple Tabs**: Close other tabs that might be using camera/mic
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Use modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### üìã Expected Behavior:
- Video calls should show both local and remote video streams
- Audio calls should only show audio controls and duration
- Call duration should display during active calls
- All participants should be able to join/leave calls cleanly
